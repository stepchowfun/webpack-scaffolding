# By default, Netlify sets `cache-control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate` on all assets. This
# means the browser has to make a request to validate every asset on the page, every time. Normally
# this is a good thing, since it means the webmaster can publish changes and expect them to be live
# immediately. However, it slows down page loads and counts against our bandwidth quota. Since we
# fingerprint most of our assets with a checksum in the filenames, we can be much more liberal with
# caching and still have deploys go live immediately. This file instructs Netlify to allow browsers
# to cache assets for 24 hours (86400 seconds).
