This repository contains the scaffolding needed to build web applications with
tools like Webpack, React, TypeScript, etc. It also includes tools for testing,
linting, formatting, etc. As you can see, it takes quite a bit of scaffolding to
set up a web application these days! The purpose of this repository is to
provide a starting point for new web projects.
